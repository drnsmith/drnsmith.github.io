              This project explores the power of machine learning and deep learning in predicting air pollution levels. It begins with data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers, followed by feature engineering to extract key predictors of PM10 concentrations. The study evaluates regression models and progresses to advanced neural networks, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for time-series forecasting. A final comparison of models highlights their strengths and real-world applicability in environmental policy and urban health initiatives.
