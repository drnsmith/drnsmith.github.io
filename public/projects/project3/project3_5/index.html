<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Sales channel performance and promotional effectiveness are key aspects that drive business success.</p>
<p>For &lsquo;OfficeProducts&rsquo;, understanding which channels contributed the most to overall sales and evaluating how promotions influenced sales trends were crucial.</p>
<p>This blog post will walk you through how we analysed sales performance across various channels and promotions using the data warehouse, and the insights we gained from these analyses.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-sales-channels">Overview of Sales Channels</h3>
<p>In the &lsquo;OfficeProducts&rsquo; data warehouse, sales channels were represented as a distinct dimension table called <strong>DIM CHANNEL</strong>.</p>
<p>This table contained details about each sales channel, such as the channel ID, channel type (e.g., direct sales, internet sales, partners), and other relevant metadata.</p>
<p>Sales data from the <strong>FACT TRANSACTIONS</strong> table was linked to this dimension, allowing us to explore sales metrics for each channel.</p>
<p>The key sales channels analysed were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Sales</strong>: Traditional sales channel with direct contact with customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internet Sales</strong>: Online sales, which became increasingly popular in recent years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partner Sales</strong>: Sales conducted through partners and resellers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysing-channel-performance-over-time">Analysing Channel Performance Over Time</h3>
<p>To analyse how each sales channel performed over time, we looked at the total sales recorded for each channel from 1998 to 2002.</p>
<p>The following SQL code was used to extract and summarise the sales for each channel by year:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">EXTRACT</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">YEAR</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> WEEKENDINGDAY) <span style="color:#66d9ef">AS</span> sales_year,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>       CHANNEL_DESC,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>       <span style="color:#66d9ef">SUM</span>(DOLLARS) <span style="color:#66d9ef">AS</span> total_sales
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> sh.fweek_pscat_sales_mv
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">GROUP</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">BY</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">ROLLUP</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">EXTRACT</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">YEAR</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> WEEKENDINGDAY), CHANNEL_DESC)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">ORDER</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">BY</span> sales_year, CHANNEL_DESC;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This <strong>ROLLUP</strong> operation allowed us to generate yearly totals as well as channel-level subtotals, which provided a clear overview of how sales were distributed across channels.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed that <strong>Direct Sales</strong> was the most dominant channel, especially during the early years (1998-2001).</p>
<p>However, we observed a significant decline in sales for this channel in 2002, which prompted further investigation into potential shifts in customer preferences.</p>
<h3 id="promotion-analysis-impact-on-sales">Promotion Analysis: Impact on Sales</h3>
<p>To evaluate the impact of various promotions, we used both <strong>ROLLUP</strong> and <strong>CUBE</strong> operations to aggregate sales data by promotion type.</p>
<p>The <strong>Promotion Analysis Materialised View (Promotion_Analysis_mv)</strong> was instrumental in this process, as it allowed us to easily analyse promotional impacts without repeatedly joining large tables.</p>
<p>The following SQL snippet illustrates the analysis of sales under different promotions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">SELECT</span> p.PROMONAME,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>       <span style="color:#66d9ef">SUM</span>(mv.TOTAL_SALES) <span style="color:#66d9ef">AS</span> TOTAL_SALES
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">FROM</span> Promotion_Analysis_mv mv
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">JOIN</span> SH.PROMOTIONS p <span style="color:#66d9ef">ON</span> mv.PROMO_ID <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> p.PROMO_ID
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">GROUP</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">BY</span> p.PROMONAME
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">ORDER</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">BY</span> TOTAL_SALES <span style="color:#66d9ef">DESC</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This analysis allowed us to identify which promotions were most successful in boosting sales.</p>
<p>For instance, <strong>Internet Promotions (#29-350)</strong> emerged as the most effective, significantly outpacing other types of promotions such as TV Promotions and Post Promotions.</p>
<h3 id="insights-derived">Insights Derived</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Direct Sales Channel Decline</strong>: The declining performance of the <strong>Direct Sales channel</strong> in 2002 suggested changing consumer behaviour, with a shift towards online purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insight was crucial for the company to adapt its strategies, potentially investing more in digital marketing and enhancing the online sales experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2. Promotional Effectiveness</strong>: The analysis showed that promotions focused on <strong>Internet sales</strong> had the highest impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Envoy Ambassador</strong> product, for instance, saw a dramatic increase in sales during internet promotional campaigns, suggesting that some products are particularly well-suited to online advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3. Bundling Opportunities</strong>: By analysing the most effective promotions, we identified opportunities to bundle high-performing products with lower-demand items to increase overall sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Products like <strong>Envoy Ambassador</strong> consistently performed well, and bundling them with complementary products could help clear inventory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channel Strategy Recommendations</strong>: Given the shift towards internet sales, it was recommended that &lsquo;OfficeProducts&rsquo; invest more in their online sales platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enhancing the user experience, expanding digital marketing efforts, and improving logistics for online deliveries could help maximise the opportunities presented by this shift in consumer preference.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Channel Adaptability</em>: The decline in Direct Sales and the rise of <strong>Internet Sales</strong> highlighted the importance of channel adaptability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses must be able to adapt their strategies to match evolving consumer behaviours, and data from a well-designed warehouse helps to spot these trends early.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Promotion Targeting</em>: Not all promotions yield equal results, and understanding which channels and product types respond best to which promotions is key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of <strong>Internet Promotions</strong> underscored the power of digital channels for certain product lines.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data-Driven Decision Making</em>: The insights gained from the multidimensional analyses enabled us to provide clear, data-backed recommendations for marketing, sales strategy, and inventory management.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, targeting high-potential products and promotions for further investment became a strategic priority.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The performance of sales channels and the impact of promotions are critical for shaping effective business strategies.</p>
<p>For &lsquo;OfficeProducts&rsquo;, the data warehouse provided a robust platform for conducting detailed analyses that uncovered key trends and insights.</p>
<p>By recognising the value of internet promotions and the shift away from traditional sales channels, &lsquo;OfficeProducts&rsquo; can now better align its future marketing and sales strategies to match consumer expectations.</p>
