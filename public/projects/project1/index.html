              Finally, I take the recipe difficulty classifier from development to deployment, making it accessible and functional in real-world applications. In this blog, you&#39;ll learn the steps I followed to prepare the model for production, including setting up a deployment environment, creating an API, and ensuring the classifier&#39;s responsiveness and reliability for end-users.

            <p class="f6">
              Next, I generate and analyse LIME visualisations to understand the modelâ€™s decision-making process. By examining highlighted words and phrases in recipes, I uncover the reasoning behind specific predictions and assess the model&#39;s biases. This step brings transparency to the classifier, revealing how AI interprets recipe complexity.

              Feature engineering is crucial for any machine learning project. In the second blog, I discuss how I extracted meaningful features from recipe data to help the AI model better understand cooking complexity. This blog covers the techniques I used to represent ingredients and cooking steps, allowing the model to distinguish between easy and challenging recipes.
