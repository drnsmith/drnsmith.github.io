{{< figure src="/images/1.jpg" title="Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Natasha (Dr. Smith) â€” AI Data Scientist | Business Strategist" >}}

Iâ€™m most in my element where **data, AI, and business strategy** converge, tackling complex challenges that drive real-world impact. With 20+ years of hands-on data experience, I blend deep technical expertise with domain knowledge in **business economics, management, and innovation**.

As a **quant and applied statistician**, I specialise in **AI engineering and machine learning**, uncovering insights, optimising decision-making, and building AI-powered solutions that move the needle. But my strength goes beyond developing modelsâ€”I translate complex technical findings into actionable business intelligence.

What sets me apart? Connecting the dots. I bridge the gap between data science and strategic decision-making, ensuring AI-driven solutions align with real business needs. Whether itâ€™s predictive modelling, automation, or AI transformation, my focus is always on measurable results.

Beyond the numbers, I explore the ethical and social implications of AI, ensuring technology is used responsibly and effectively. My work reflects this integration of analytical rigour, business insight, and human-centred innovationâ€”where data meets strategy, intelligence, and impact.


I believe in **building a community** of like-minded professionals who are passionate about AI, data, and its intersection with business.  **Letâ€™s exchange ideas and grow together!** Connect with me on **[LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/drnsmith)** and letâ€™s learn from each other.
