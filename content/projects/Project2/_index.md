title: "Combining advanced NLP techniques (BERT embeddings) with LDA topic modelling."
description: "This project explores the fusion of advanced NLP techniques (BERT embeddings), with traditional methods (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to semantically cluster and analyse recipes. It demonstrates how hybrid NLP methodologies can transform large-scale textual data into actionable insights, paving the way for applications in content recommendation, personalised recipe discovery, and trend analysis in the culinary domain."
