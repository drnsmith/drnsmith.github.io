### Introduction. Clustering Recipes Based on Similarity: An Overview of Techniques and Challenges

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique that organises data points into groups based on shared features. 

When applied to recipes, clustering can reveal hidden patterns, such as regional cuisines, ingredient pairings, or common preparation techniques.

In this blog, we’ll explore:

1. Clustering methods like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
2. Pre-processing and feature selection for recipe data.
3. Evaluating clusters for meaningfulness.
4. Challenges and lessons learned during clustering experiments.

### Why Clustering Recipes?

Clustering allows us to group recipes into meaningful categories based on similarity. For example:

- **Cuisine Identification:** Grouping recipes by regional influences (e.g., Italian, Asian).
- **Dietary Patterns:** Identifying clusters based on health-focused recipes (e.g., vegan, keto).
- **Ingredient Analysis:** Understanding ingredient combinations across recipes.

### Pre-processing Recipe Data for Clustering

To effectively cluster recipes, pre-processing steps are crucial. In this project, this included:

1. **Text Tokenisation:** Breaking down recipe descriptions into meaningful words.
2. **Vectorisation:** Using techniques like TF-IDF or embeddings to convert text into numerical data.
3. **Feature Selection:** Focusing on essential elements, such as key ingredients or cooking methods.

Here’s a code snippet showing how recipes were vectorised using TF-IDF:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample recipe descriptions
recipe_texts = ["Chicken curry with rice", "Vegan pasta with tomato sauce", "Grilled salmon with herbs"]

# TF-IDF vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=100)
recipe_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(recipe_texts)
```
### Clustering Techniques

### 1. K-Means Clustering
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that groups data points by minimising the distance between points in the same cluster.

Steps:
 - Define the number of clusters (k).
 - Assign each recipe to the nearest cluster center.
 - Update cluster centers until convergence.

Here’s how I applied K-Means in this project:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Apply K-Means with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(recipe_vectors)

# Print cluster assignments
print(clusters)
```

### Challenges:

 - *Choosing the Right k*: Selecting the number of clusters required testing different values using metrics like the Elbow Method.
 - *Sparse Data*: Recipe data often has sparse features, making it harder to define clear clusters.

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to visualize cluster relationships.

Steps:
 - Compute distances between data points.
 - Merge points iteratively based on similarity.

Here’s a sample implementation:

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Hierarchical clustering
linked = linkage(recipe_vectors.toarray(), method='ward')
dendrogram(linked)
plt.show()
```

### Advantages:

 - Does not require predefining the number of clusters.
 - Provides a visual representation of cluster relationships.

### Challenges:

 - Computationally expensive for large datasets.
 - Requires domain knowledge to interpret dendrograms effectively.

### Evaluating Clustering Results

I evaluated clusters using:

 - *Silhouette Score*: Measures how similar a recipe is to its own cluster compared to others.
 - *Manual Inspection*: Reviewing sample recipes from each cluster to assess meaningfulness.

Here’s how I calculated the silhouette score:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Evaluate clustering
score = silhouette_score(recipe_vectors, clusters)
print(f"Silhouette Score: {score}")
```

### Key Lessons Learned
 - *Feature Quality Matters*: The choice of features (e.g., ingredients vs. cooking steps) significantly impacts clustering results.
 - *Iterative Tuning*: Fine-tuning parameters like the number of clusters is critical for meaningful groupings.
 - *Context is Key*: Domain knowledge helps interpret clusters effectively.

### Final Thoughts
Clustering recipes offers fascinating insights into culinary data, but it also comes with challenges like sparse data and parameter tuning. 

By leveraging techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, and carefully evaluating results, we can uncover valuable themes and patterns in recipes.
