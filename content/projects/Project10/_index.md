title: "Cancer Detection in Histopathology: The Role of Colour Normalisation in Model Calibration and Performance"
description: "This project explores the role of color normalisation and data augmentation in improving cancer detection accuracy in histopathology images. By analysing the impact of pre-processing techniques like Channel-Based Normalisation, Colour Deconvolution, and CLAHE on model calibration and performance, the study provides valuable insights into scalable and robust AI workflows for medical imaging."
