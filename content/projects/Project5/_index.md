title: "AI-Driven Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks"
description: "This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By leveraging CNNs, including both a custom architecture and a pre-trained VGG16 model, the project achieved accurate classification of chest X-rays into 'Normal' and 'Pneumonia' categories. This project showcases the power of CNNs in tackling real-world challenges in medical imaging while addressing the nuances of dataset preparation and model evaluation."
