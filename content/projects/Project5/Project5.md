# Part 1. Challenges in Medical Imaging Datasets

Medical imaging datasets provide critical opportunities for deep learning (DL) applications, but they also come with unique challenges. In this project, aimed at detecting pneumonia using chest X-rays, we faced hurdles like **dataset imbalance** and **small validation sets**, which can hinder model performance. This blog discusses the key challenges and demonstrates pre-processing techniques—such as dataset re-sampling, data augmentation, and re-splitting—that helped us overcome these obstacles.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset consisted of labelled chest X-ray images classified as:

 - **Normal**

 - **Pneumonia** (further divided into "bacterial" and "viral pneumonia").

#### Key Challenges
1. *Class Imbalance*:
   - The dataset had significantly more images for pneumonia cases than for normal cases, potentially biasing the model.
2. *Small Validation Set*:
   - The original split provided a limited number of images for validation, making it difficult to assess generalisation.

### Handling Class Imbalance

To mitigate class imbalance, we used **resampling techniques**:
 - **Oversampling**: Increasing the number of samples in the minority class.
 - **Undersampling**: Reducing the number of samples in the majority class.

#### Python Code: Re-sampling Dataset
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.utils import resample
import os
import shutil

# Resampling images for the 'Normal' class
def resample_images(class_dir, target_count):
    """
    Re-samples images for a given class directory.
    Args:
    class_dir (str): Path to the class folder (e.g., 'train/Normal').
    target_count (int): Desired number of images for the class.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    images = os.listdir(class_dir)
    if len(images) < target_count:
        # Oversampling: Duplicate random images
        while len(images) < target_count:
            img_to_duplicate = np.random.choice(images)
            src_path = os.path.join(class_dir, img_to_duplicate)
            dst_path = os.path.join(class_dir, f"copy_{len(images)}_{img_to_duplicate}")
            shutil.copy(src_path, dst_path)
            images.append(dst_path)
    else:
        print(f"Class already has {len(images)} images. No oversampling needed.")

# Resample 'Normal' class to match the 'Pneumonia' class size
resample_images("train/Normal", target_count=4000)
```

### Resplitting the Dataset

The dataset was resplit to ensure sufficient images in the validation and test sets, enhancing model evaluation.

#### Python Code: Splitting Dataset
```python

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example: Splitting the 'Pneumonia' class
def split_class_images(class_dir, val_size=0.2, test_size=0.2):
    """
    Splits class images into train, validation, and test sets.
    Args:
    class_dir (str): Path to the class folder (e.g., 'data/Pneumonia').
    val_size (float): Proportion of images for validation.
    test_size (float): Proportion of images for testing.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    images = os.listdir(class_dir)
    train_images, temp_images = train_test_split(images, test_size=(val_size + test_size))
    val_images, test_images = train_test_split(temp_images, test_size=test_size / (val_size + test_size))

    for img in train_images:
        shutil.move(os.path.join(class_dir, img), "train/Pneumonia/")
    for img in val_images:
        shutil.move(os.path.join(class_dir, img), "val/Pneumonia/")
    for img in test_images:
        shutil.move(os.path.join(class_dir, img), "test/Pneumonia/")

# Split images for Pneumonia class
split_class_images("data/Pneumonia", val_size=0.2, test_size=0.2)
```

### Balancing Validation and Test Sets

Ensuring balanced datasets in validation and test splits helped achieve more reliable performance metrics. This was done by monitoring the class distribution after splitting.

#### Python Code: Checking Class Distribution

```python

from collections import Counter

def check_distribution(dir_path):
    """
    Checks class distribution in a dataset directory.
    Args:
    dir_path (str): Path to the dataset directory (e.g., 'val').

    Returns:
    dict: Class counts.
    """
    class_counts = Counter([folder for folder in os.listdir(dir_path)])
    print("Class Distribution:", class_counts)
    return class_counts

# Check validation set distribution
check_distribution("val")
```

### Results of Pre-processing
 - *Balanced Classes*: After resampling, both 'Normal' and 'Pneumonia' classes had approximately equal representation in training, validation, and test sets.

 - *Improved Evaluation*: Resplitting ensured that validation and test datasets reflected real-world distributions, reducing overfitting.

### Challenges in Pre-processing

 - *Risk of Overfitting*: Oversampling increases the likelihood of overfitting, especially with small datasets. *Solution*: Complement oversampling with data augmentation.

 - *Resource Constraints*: Resampling large datasets can strain storage and computational resources. *Solution*: Optimise code for batch processing and utilise cloud storage if necessary.

#### Summary
Addressing challenges in medical imaging datasets is critical for building reliable DL models. By balancing class distributions and resplitting datasets, we improved the quality of training and evaluation for pneumonia detection.


# Part 2. Boosting Model Generalisation with Data Augmentation
DL models often struggle with overfitting, especially when trained on limited datasets. To overcome this challenge, we used **data augmentation** (DA) techniques to artificially expand the training dataset. DA techniques, such as *rotations, scaling, flipping, and zooming*, helped improve the model's generalisation to unseen chest X-ray images. In this part I'll explain the DA techniques we applied, provide with demonstrates the snippets of `Python` code used, and highlight how augmentation enhanced the performance of both the manual CNN and the pre-trained VGG16 models.

### Why Data Augmentation?

Medical imaging datasets, including chest X-rays, often have limited samples due to privacy concerns and collection difficulties. This leads to:

 - *Overfitting*: Models learn noise instead of generalisable patterns.
 - *Bias*: Models may struggle with unseen data due to lack of variability in the training set.

DA tackles these issues by generating diverse versions of existing images, effectively increasing the dataset size and variability.

### Techniques Used

 - *Rotation*: Randomly rotates images within a specified range (e.g., ±15°).
 - *Scaling*: Enlarges or shrinks images, simulating distance variations.
 - *Horizontal Flipping*: Mirrors images horizontally to introduce spatial diversity.
 - *Zooming*: Randomly zooms into or out of an image.
 - *Shifting*: Translates images along the X and Y axes.

We used `TensorFlow`'s `ImageDataGenerator` to apply augmentation during training.

#### Python Code: DA Setup
```python

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Define augmentation parameters
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode="nearest"
)
# Load training images and apply augmentation
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    "train",
    target_size=(150, 150),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode="binary"
)
```
### Visualisation of Augmented Images

Visualising augmented images helps ensure the transformations are realistic and meaningful.

#### Python Code: Visualising Augmented Images

```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load a single image from the training directory
img_path = "train/Normal/normal_sample.jpeg"
img = plt.imread(img_path)
img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

# Generate augmented images
augmented_images = datagen.flow(img, batch_size=1)

# Plot augmented images
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i in range(9):
    plt.subplot(3, 3, i + 1)
    batch = next(augmented_images)
    augmented_img = batch[0]
    plt.imshow(augmented_img.astype("uint8"))
    plt.axis("off")
plt.suptitle("Augmented Images")
plt.show()
```
### Impact of Augmentation on Model Performance

DA significantly improved the generalisation capabilities of both models:

**Manual CNN**:

 - Training accuracy: 95%
 - Validation accuracy: 87% (without augmentation) → 91% (with augmentation)

**VGG16**:

 - Training accuracy: 97%
 - Validation accuracy: 89% (without augmentation) → 93% (with augmentation)

{{< figure src="/images/confusion_matrix.png">}}

#### Challenges with Augmentation

 - *Computational Overhead*: Augmentation increases training time as new images are generated on the fly. *Solution*: Use GPU acceleration to speed up the process.

 - *Over-Augmentation*: Excessive transformations may distort critical features in medical images.
*Solution*: Restrict parameters like rotation and zoom to realistic ranges.

#### Summary

DA proved to be a powerful tool for enhancing model performance in this pneumonia detection project. By introducing variability in the training dataset, we improved the generalisation of both the manual CNN and the pre-trained VGG16 models.

# Part 3. Manual CNN vs. Pre-Trained VGG16: A Comparative Analysis

DL provides multiple pathways to solving problems, including designing custom architectures or leveraging pre-trained models. In this part, I'll compare the performance of a **manual CNN** and the *VGG16* pre-trained model for pneumonia detection. While the manual CNN was lightweight and tailored to the dataset, VGG16 brought the power of **transfer learning** with its pre-trained *ImageNet* weights. This comparative analysis explores their architectures, training strategies, and results.

### Manual CNN: Tailored for the Dataset

The manually designed CNN aimed to strike a balance between simplicity and performance. It consisted of convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for down-sampling, and dense layers for classification. Architecture:
- *Convolution Layers*: Extract features like edges and textures.
- *MaxPooling Layers*: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
- *Dense Layers*: Combine extracted features for classification.

#### Python Code: Manual CNN Architecture
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

def build_manual_cnn(input_shape):
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=input_shape),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
    ])
    return model

# Initialise model
manual_cnn = build_manual_cnn((150, 150, 3))
manual_cnn.summary()
```
1. **Strengths**
 - *Lightweight*: Fewer parameters compared to large pre-trained models.
 - *Flexibility*: Architecture tailored to chest X-ray data.

2. **Limitations**
 - *Learning from Scratch*: Lacks the knowledge pre-trained on large datasets like *ImageNet*.
 - *Longer Training Time*: Requires more epochs to converge.

### VGG16: Transfer Learning in Action

VGG16 is a popular pre-trained CNN that has demonstrated strong performance in image classification tasks. By freezing its convolutional layers, we leveraged its pre-trained weights for feature extraction while fine-tuning the dense layers for pneumonia detection. **Architecture**:

 - *Feature Extraction Layers*: Pre-trained convolutional layers from VGG16.
 - *Dense Layers*: Custom layers added for binary classification.

#### Python Code: VGG16 Model
```python

from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense, Dropout

def build_vgg16(input_shape):
    base_model = VGG16(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=input_shape)
    model = Sequential([
        base_model,
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
    ])
    base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze pre-trained layers
    return model

# Initialise model
vgg16_model = build_vgg16((150, 150, 3))
vgg16_model.summary()
```

1. **Strengths**
 - *Transfer Learning*: Pre-trained weights accelerate training and improve accuracy.
 - *Feature Richness*: Extracts high-level features from images.

2. **Limitations**
 - *Heavy Architecture*: High computational requirements.
 - *Over-fitting Risk*: Fine-tuning dense layers requires careful monitoring.

#### Training Strategies
Both models were trained on the augmented dataset with the same optimiser, learning rate, and number of epochs.

```python

from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Data augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory("train", target_size=(150, 150), batch_size=32, class_mode="binary")
val_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory("val", target_size=(150, 150), batch_size=32, class_mode="binary")

# Compile and train the model
manual_cnn.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
vgg16_model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train models
manual_cnn.fit(train_generator, validation_data=val_generator, epochs=10)
vgg16_model.fit(train_generator, validation_data=val_generator, epochs=10)
```

#### Comparison of Results
{{< figure src="/images/performance.png">}}

 - *Training Speed*: Manual CNN converged more slowly compared to VGG16.

 - *Accuracy*: VGG16 outperformed the manual CNN by 2% in validation accuracy.

 - *Recall*: VGG16 achieved higher recall, crucial for detecting pneumonia cases with minimal false negatives.

####  Key Takeaways

1. *Manual CNN*:

 - Lightweight and effective for datasets with limited computational resources.
 - Requires more training time and careful tuning.

2. *VGG16*:

 - Transfer learning provides a significant performance boost.
 - Ideal for medical imaging projects with access to powerful hardware.

#### Summary
Both models demonstrated strong performance, but VGG16’s transfer learning capabilities gave it a slight edge in accuracy and recall. However, the manual CNN remains a viable alternative for scenarios with limited computational resources or hardware constraints.

# Part 4. Evaluating CNN Models for Pneumonia Detection

Evaluating the performance of deep learning models in medical imaging projects requires more than just accuracy. Metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** provide deeper insights, especially when minimising false negatives is critical, as in pneumonia detection. In this part, I explore how our models—*Manual CNN* and *VGG16* — were evaluated and highlights the role of confusion matrices in understanding their performance.

### Metrics for Evaluation

1. *Accuracy*: The percentage of correctly classified samples.
   - Formula: `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`

2. *Precision*: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
   - Formula: `TP / (TP + FP)`

3. *Recall (Sensitivity)*: Measures how well the model identifies positive cases (critical for medical diagnostics).
   - Formula: `TP / (TP + FN)`

4. *F1-Score*: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - Formula: `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

5. *Confusion Matrix*: A table that summarises the counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

#### Python Code: Model Evaluation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def evaluate_model(model, test_dir):
    """
    Evaluates the model on the test dataset and generates a confusion matrix.
    """
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
    test_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
        test_dir,
        target_size=(150, 150),
        batch_size=1,
        class_mode="binary",
        shuffle=False
    )

    # Predictions and ground truth
    predictions = (model.predict(test_generator) > 0.5).astype("int32")
    y_true = test_generator.classes

    # Classification report
    print("\nClassification Report:")
    print(classification_report(y_true, predictions, target_names=test_generator.class_indices.keys()))

    # Confusion matrix
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, predictions)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues",
                xticklabels=test_generator.class_indices.keys(),
                yticklabels=test_generator.class_indices.keys())
    plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
    plt.xlabel("Predicted")
    plt.ylabel("Actual")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
from model_training import build_manual_cnn  # Import the model architecture
manual_cnn = build_manual_cnn(input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
manual_cnn.load_weights("path_to_manual_cnn_weights.h5")  # Load the trained weights

evaluate_model(manual_cnn, "test")
```

#### Results
{{< figure src="/images/results.png">}}

**Key Observations**

*Manual CNN*:

 - High precision but slightly lower recall.
 - Missed a few positive cases (false negatives), which is critical in medical diagnostics.

*VGG16*:

 - Slightly better performance across all metrics.
 - Higher recall reduced false negatives, making it better suited for pneumonia detection.

#### Challenges in Evaluation
 - *Class Imbalance*: Imbalanced test data can skew metrics. *Solution*: Use balanced datasets for evaluation or weighted metrics.
 - *Interpretation of Metrics*: Precision and recall trade-offs must be carefully analysed. *Solution*: Prioritise recall for medical applications to minimise missed cases.
 - *Threshold Tuning*: A fixed threshold (e.g., 0.5) may not work optimally for all models. *Solution*: Experiment with threshold values to maximise recall without sacrificing precision.

#### Summary
Model evaluation provided crucial insights into the performance of our CNN models. While both models performed well, VGG16's higher recall made it the preferred choice for pneumonia detection, as it minimises the risk of missing positive cases.

# Part 5. Insights from Sensitivity and Specificity Analysis in Pneumonia Detection

When evaluating AI models for medical diagnostics, metrics like **sensitivity** and **specificity** are crucial. Unlike general-purpose accuracy, these metrics provide deeper insights into how well a model distinguishes between true positive and true negative cases. For pneumonia detection, where false negatives can have severe consequences, understanding these metrics is essential. In this part, I break down sensitivity and specificity, demonstrate their importance in model evaluation, and analyse how they influenced our choice between the Manual CNN and VGG16 models.

### Understanding Sensitivity and Specificity

1. *Sensitivity (Recall)*: Measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases (patients with pneumonia).
   - *Formula*: `Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)`
   - High sensitivity reduces false negatives, which is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment.

2. *Specificity*: Measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative cases (healthy patients).
   - *Formula*: `Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)`
   - High specificity reduces false positives, ensuring healthy patients are not misdiagnosed.


### Why These Metrics Matter in Pneumonia Detection

1. **Sensitivity Prioritisation**:
   - Missing a pneumonia case (false negative) can lead to delayed treatment and severe outcomes.
   - High sensitivity ensures most pneumonia cases are detected.

2. **Balancing Specificity**:
   - While high sensitivity is critical, specificity ensures resources are not wasted on unnecessary follow-ups for false positives.

### Python Code: Calculating Sensitivity and Specificity

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_sensitivity_specificity(confusion_matrix):
    """
    Calculates sensitivity and specificity from a confusion matrix.
    Args:
    confusion_matrix (ndarray): 2x2 confusion matrix [[TN, FP], [FN, TP]].

    Returns:
    dict: Sensitivity and specificity values.
    """
    TN, FP, FN, TP = confusion_matrix.ravel()
    sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
    specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
    return {"Sensitivity": sensitivity, "Specificity": specificity}

# Example confusion matrices
manual_cnn_cm = np.array([[200, 15], [25, 260]])
vgg16_cm = np.array([[210, 10], [20, 270]])

# Calculate metrics
manual_metrics = calculate_sensitivity_specificity(manual_cnn_cm)
vgg16_metrics = calculate_sensitivity_specificity(vgg16_cm)

print("Manual CNN Metrics:", manual_metrics)
print("VGG16 Metrics:", vgg16_metrics)
```
Output:

*For Manual CNN*:

 - Sensitivity: 91.2%
 - Specificity: 93.0%

*For VGG16*:

 - Sensitivity: 93.1%
 - Specificity: 95.5%

#### Performance Comparison
*Manual CNN*:
 - Strength: Balanced performance with reasonable sensitivity and specificity.
 - Limitation: Slightly lower sensitivity could lead to missed pneumonia cases.

*VGG16*:
 - Strength: Higher sensitivity reduces false negatives, making it more reliable for detecting pneumonia.
 - Limitation: Marginally lower specificity compared to manual CNN.

Balancing sensitivity and specificity is key in medical diagnostics:

 - *High Sensitivity*: Essential for critical conditions like pneumonia, where missing a positive case can have life-threatening consequences. Prioritise recall over precision.

 - *High Specificity*: Reduces false positives, minimising unnecessary stress, costs, and resource usage.Important in resource-limited settings.

#### Visualising the Trade-offs
We used the `Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)` curve to visualise the sensitivity-specificity trade-off across different thresholds.

#### Python Code: ROC Curve
```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_roc_curve(model, test_generator):
    """
    Plots the ROC curve for a given model and test data.
    """
    y_true = test_generator.classes
    y_pred = model.predict(test_generator).ravel()

    fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_true, y_pred)
    roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color="blue", label=f"ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})")
    plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color="gray", linestyle="--")
    plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity)")
    plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)")
    plt.title("ROC Curve")
    plt.legend(loc="lower right")
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()

# Example usage with VGG16 model
plot_roc_curve(vgg16_model, test_generator)
```

#### Key Takeaways
1. VGG16 Outperforms:

 - The higher sensitivity and `ROC AUC` score make VGG16 a better choice for pneumonia detection.
 - Reduces false negatives, ensuring more pneumonia cases are caught.

2. Manual CNN is Reliable:

 - Offers a balanced approach, with decent sensitivity and specificity.
 - Suitable for scenarios with resource constraints.

#### Summary
Sensitivity and specificity are critical metrics in evaluating AI models for medical imaging. While both the Manual CNN and VGG16 demonstrated strong performance, VGG16’s superior sensitivity makes it the preferred choice for pneumonia detection, prioritising patient safety.

# Part 6. Future Directions for AI-Assisted Medical Imaging

AI made significant strides in medical imaging, as demonstrated by our pneumonia detection project. 
However, the journey is far from complete. Future advancements in deep learning, real-world deployment, and ethical considerations will shape the role of AI in diagnostics and healthcare delivery. In this part, I'll explore the potential and challenges of AI in medical imaging, including future directions for improving model performance, ensuring ethical deployment, and scaling solutions for global healthcare.

### 1. Improving Model Performance

#### a. Multimodal Learning
Future models could integrate multiple data types (e.g., imaging, clinical notes, and patient history) to improve diagnostic accuracy.
- Example: Combining X-ray images with patient demographics or blood test results.
- Impact: Provides a holistic view for more accurate diagnosis.

#### b. Advanced Architectures
Emerging architectures like Vision Transformers (ViT) and hybrid models could outperform traditional CNNs by better capturing global features in images.
- **Vision Transformers**:
  - Use self-attention mechanisms for image classification.
  - Suitable for large datasets and complex features.

#### c. Real-Time Analysis
Deploying lightweight models on edge devices (e.g., hospital machines) can enable real-time diagnostics. *Example*: On-device pneumonia detection for portable X-ray machines.

#### Python Code: Example of Hybrid Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Hybrid Model with ResNet50 backbone
def build_hybrid_model(input_shape):
    base_model = ResNet50(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=input_shape)
    model = Sequential([
        base_model,
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
    ])
    base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze pre-trained layers
    return model

# Initialise model
hybrid_model = build_hybrid_model((150, 150, 3))
hybrid_model.summary()
```

### 2. Deployment Challenges
*Data Privacy and Security:* Patient data must remain secure and anonymised to comply with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. *Solution*: Use federated learning to train models across distributed datasets without transferring sensitive data.

*Generalisation to Diverse Populations:* AI models often struggle with data from populations or imaging devices different from the training dataset. *Solution*: Continuously retrain and validate models on diverse datasets.

*Infrastructure Limitations:* Deploying AI in resource-limited settings (e.g., rural hospitals) requires lightweight models and affordable hardware. *Solution*: Optimise models for edge devices and cloud-based inference.

### 3. Ethical Considerations
*Transparency*: AI models should provide interpretable outputs to assist clinicians in decision-making. *Example*: Visualising heatmaps over X-ray images to show regions influencing predictions.

*Bias in AI Models*: Training datasets may reflect biases, such as under-representation of certain demographic groups. *Solution*: Perform bias audits and balance datasets during training.

*Accountability:* Define clear protocols for responsibility when AI models make incorrect predictions. *Solution*: AI systems should augment, not replace, human decision-making.

#### Python Code: Explainability with Grad-CAM
```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def generate_gradcam(model, img_array, last_conv_layer_name):
