title: " Building Accurate AI Models for Breast Cancer Detection"
description: "This project focuses on building robust AI models for breast cancer diagnosis using histopathological images. It begins by exploring the transformative impact of deep learning in clinical diagnostics, then tackles practical challenges such as class imbalance and the need for data augmentation. Multiple convolutional neural network architectures—ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet—are compared and combined in ensemble models to maximise diagnostic accuracy. This foundation sets the stage for AI systems that perform with speed, precision, and reliability in medical imaging."
