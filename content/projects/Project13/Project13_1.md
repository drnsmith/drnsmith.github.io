# Part 2. Handling Class Imbalance in Medical Imaging: A Deep Learning Perspective
Class imbalance is a common issue in histopathological datasets, and the BreakHis dataset, used for breast cancer detection, is not an exception. The imbalance, where benign samples constitute 31% and malignant samples 69%, can adversely affect model performance by causing the model to prioritise the majority class. 

In this part, we explore techniques employed in this project, including **weighted loss functions**, **data augmentation**, and **stratified sampling**, to address this challenge and enhance model performance.

### Class Imbalance in the BreakHis Dataset

The `BreakHis` dataset comprises 7,909 images of breast tissue biopsies, categorised into benign and malignant classes. The dataset's inherent class imbalance highlights the need for tailored solutions to prevent the model from favoring the dominant malignant class at the expense of underrepresented benign samples.


#### Techniques to Address Class Imbalance

 - 1. **Weighted Loss Functions (WLF):** Penalise misclassifications in the minority class more heavily, ensuring the model learns to treat all classes with equal importance. 

I implemented a custom **weighted binary cross-entropy loss function**, with weights inversely proportional to class frequencies:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.losses import BinaryCrossentropy

# Compute class weights
class_counts = {0: 2480, 1: 5429}  # Benign (0) and Malignant (1)
total_samples = sum(class_counts.values())
class_weights = {
    0: total_samples / (2 * class_counts[0]),
    1: total_samples / (2 * class_counts[1])
}

# Compile model with weighted loss
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=BinaryCrossentropy(), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, class_weight=class_weights, epochs=20, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces bias toward the majority class.
- Improves sensitivity for the minority class, crucial in detecting benign cases.


 - 2. **Data Augmentation (DA):** Expands the dataset by creating synthetic variations of existing images, increasing diversity and balancing class representation.

I applied the following DA techniques:
- *Flipping*: Simulates variations in orientation.
- *Rotation*: Introduces diverse angles for the same sample.
- *Scaling*: Mimics different magnification levels.
- *Shearing*: Distorts images slightly for variation.

I used `TensorFlow`’s `ImageDataGenerator` to dynamically generate augmented samples during training:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

# Apply augmentation to training data
train_generator = datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
model.fit(train_generator, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=20)
```
![Examples of augmented images from the training set](/images/DA.png)
*Examples of augmented images from the training set.*
**Benefits**:
- Increases dataset diversity, reducing overfitting.
- Enhances the model's robustness to real-world variations.

 - 3. **Stratified Sampling:**
Ensures that both training and validation sets maintain the same class distribution as the original dataset. This technique prevents evaluation biases caused by imbalanced splits.

I used `train_test_split` with stratification:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    images, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels, random_state=42
)
```

**Benefits**:
- Maintains balanced class distributions in both training and validation sets.
- Provides consistent and reliable evaluation metrics.

### Results and Insights

#### Impact of Techniques
The combination of WLFs, DA, and stratified sampling significantly improved the model's ability to detect benign samples, addressing the class imbalance challenge.

**Performance Metrics**:
| **Model**          | **Accuracy** | **Sensitivity (Benign)** | **Sensitivity (Malignant)** |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Baseline (No Techniques) | 89.2%       | 62.1%                    | 96.8%                      |
| Weighted Loss Only  | 93.7%       | 85.3%                    | 95.1%                      |
| Weighted Loss + Augmentation | 96.2%       | 89.8%                    | 97.4%                      |

Augmented images demonstrate the diversity introduced by augmentation techniques. Comparison of confusion matrices with and without class imbalance handling highlighted the improved detection of benign cases.

### Summary

Class imbalance is a critical challenge in medical imaging datasets, but techniques like weighted loss functions, data augmentation, and stratified sampling provide effective solutions. By implementing these approaches, I significantly enhanced the performance of DL models on the BreakHis dataset, improving sensitivity for minority classes and ensuring robust, fair predictions.


# Part 3. Choosing the Best CNN Architecture: How Ensemble Models Improve Breast Cancer Detection with AI

### Introduction
DL has revolutionised breast cancer detection, especially with histopathological image analysis. Among the arsenal of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, models like **ResNet**, **DenseNet**, and **EfficientNet** have proven highly effective. However, instead of relying on a single architecture, combining them through ensemble learning often yields superior performance. In this part, we’ll compare these top architectures and explore how an **ensemble approach using logistic regression** as a meta-model improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness.

### The Role of CNNs in Histopathology

Histopathological imaging involves analysing tissue samples to detect abnormalities like cancer. CNNs excel at this task, learning intricate patterns like cell shapes, textures, and densities. However, different architectures have unique strengths:

- Some are better at hierarchical feature extraction (e.g., `ResNet`),
- Others excel at efficient feature propagation (e.g., `DenseNet`),
- And some balance performance with resource efficiency (e.g., `EfficientNet`).

An ensemble approach leverages these strengths, combining models to create a powerful diagnostic system.

### Comparing Top CNN Architectures

 - 1. **ResNet (Residual Networks):** Introduced residual connections, allowing for very deep networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

**Key Features**:
- Residual learning facilitates hierarchical feature extraction.
- `ResNet50` and `ResNet101` are highly accurate in classifying complex datasets.

**Performance in Histopathology**:
- `ResNet50` showed strong performance in distinguishing benign from malignant tissue, especially for high-resolution images.


 - 2. **DenseNet (Densely Connected Networks):** Connects each layer to every other layer, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.

**Key Features**:
- Dense feature reuse enables compact but effective models.
- `DenseNet201` is particularly adept at detecting subtle differences in histopathological images.

**Performance in Histopathology**:
- Found to be very effective at identifying rare tumour subtypes and texture-based features.


 - 3. **EfficientNet:** Optimises network depth, width, and resolution simultaneously for better efficiency and scalability.

**Key Features**:
- Highly efficient models with excellent performance on smaller datasets.
- `EfficientNetB0` performed particularly well in handling the `BreakHis` dataset’s limited size.

**Performance in Histopathology**:
- Scalable performance makes it suitable for resource-constrained setups.

### Ensemble Learning: Combining the Best

Rather than selecting one architecture, an ensemble model combines multiple CNNs to improve accuracy and robustness. In this project, **ResNet50**, **DenseNet201**, and **EfficientNetB0** were combined using a **logistic regression meta-model**.

**How the Ensemble Works**
1. *Feature Extraction*:
   - Each CNN independently predicts probabilities for benign and malignant classes.
2. **Meta-Model Aggregation**:
   - Logistic regression combines these predictions to produce a final output.

**Implementation**:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Predictions from individual models
resnet_preds = resnet_model.predict(x_test)
densenet_preds = densenet_model.predict(x_test)
efficientnet_preds = efficientnet_model.predict(x_test)

# Stack predictions as input for logistic regression
ensemble_input = np.column_stack((resnet_preds, densenet_preds, efficientnet_preds))

# Train logistic regression meta-model
meta_model = LogisticRegression()
meta_model.fit(ensemble_input, y_test)

# Make final predictions
final_preds = meta_model.predict(ensemble_input)
```

**Benefits**:
- Combines the strengths of each architecture.
- Mitigates individual model weaknesses (e.g., sensitivity vs. specificity trade-offs).

**Performance Metrics**:
| **Model**          | **Accuracy** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **F1-Score** |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| ResNet50            | 94.2%       | 91.5%           | 96.3%           | 92.8%         |
| DenseNet201         | 93.8%       | 89.7%           | 95.1%           | 91.1%         |
| EfficientNetB0      | 92.4%       | 90.3%           | 94.8%           | 91.0%         |
| **Ensemble (LogReg)** | **96.8%**   | **94.7%**       | **98.5%**       | **96.1%**     |

---

#### **Advantages of Ensembles in Histopathology**

1. **Improved Generalisation**:
   - Ensembles combine diverse predictions, reducing overfitting and variance.
2. **Robustness to Noise**:
   - Handles noisy or ambiguous samples better than individual models.
3. **Enhanced Sensitivity and Specificity**:
   - Balances the trade-off between false negatives and false positives, critical for medical imaging.

#### **Case Study: Breast Cancer Detection**

In this project, the ensemble model significantly outperformed individual CNN architectures:

- *Sensitivity* for detecting benign samples improved, addressing the class imbalance issue.
- *Specificity* and *F1-score* surpassed benchmarks set by individual models.


### Summary

Choosing the best CNN architecture for breast cancer detection depends on the dataset and requirements. While ResNet excels at hierarchical feature learning, DenseNet propagates features efficiently, and EfficientNet balances performance and resources. 

Combining them through an ensemble approach with a logistic regression meta-model provides the best results, improving accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. 

This ensemble strategy represents a robust solution for leveraging AI in histopathology, paving the way for reliable and precise diagnostics.

# Part 4. Boosting AI Performance: Data Augmentation for Histopathological Imaging


In medical imaging, especially in histopathology, DL models often face challenges such as limited datasets and class imbalances. These limitations can hinder the performance of models and their generalization to new data. 

A powerful technique to overcome these issues is **data augmentation (DA)**—synthetically increasing the size and diversity of the training data. In this part, we’ll dive into how DA techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling can enhance DL models for medical imaging.

### **Challenges in Histopathological Imaging**

1. **Data Scarcity**: Medical imaging datasets are often small due to the difficulty of collecting labelled data.
2. **Class Imbalance**: Some categories, like rare cancer types, are underrepresented in datasets.
3. **Overfitting**: Models trained on small datasets can memorise rather than generalise, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

DA addresses these challenges by artificially expanding the dataset and introducing variations that simulate real-world scenarios.


### Data Augmentation: The Key Techniques

DA involves applying transformations to images, creating variations while preserving their labels. Common techniques include:

1. *Flipping*: Horizontal and vertical flips simulate different orientations.
2. *Rotation*: Rotating images at random angles helps models handle rotation-invariant features.
3. *Scaling*: Zooming in or out mimics variations in magnification.
4. *Shearing*: Distorting images at angles introduces diverse perspectives.
5. *Colour Jittering*: Altering brightness, contrast, or saturation expands colr-based variations.


For DA, I used `TensorFlow`’s `ImageDataGenerator`n:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

# Generate augmented images
train_generator = datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
```

### Architecture

I used `ResNet50` model as the backbone, and extended with additional layers for binary classification (e.g., cancer detection).

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten

def build_resnet50_model():
    model = Sequential()
    backbone = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
    model.add(backbone)
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    return model
```

#### Training 

```python
early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)
reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.5, patience=2)

history = resnet50_model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=len(x_train) // 32,
    epochs=20,
    validation_data=val_generator,
    callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr]
)
```

#### Impact of Data Augmentation

 - 1. *Increased Dataset Diversity:*
DA artificially expands the dataset size, introducing variations that the model can learn to handle.

 - 2. *Improved Generalisation:*
By learning from diverse DA, the model performed better on unseen data, reducing overfitting.

**Results**:
| **Metric**     | **Without Augmentation** | **With Augmentation** |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Accuracy        | 85%                      | 91%                    |
| Sensitivity     | 78%                      | 88%                    |
| Specificity     | 80%                      | 89%                    |


 - 3. *Addressing Class Imbalances:*
Augmentation can balance underrepresented classes by applying transformations more frequently to minority class samples.

```python
datagen_minority = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=30,
    zoom_range=0.3,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

minority_class_images = datagen_minority.flow(minority_images, batch_size=32)
```
#### Best Practices for Medical Data Augmentation

1. *Domain Knowledge*: Tailor augmentations to reflect real-world variability (e.g., rotations for tissue samples).
2. *Avoid Over-Augmentation*: Excessive transformations can distort the data and degrade performance.
3. *Combine with Pre-processing*: Apply augmentations alongside pre-processing steps like normalisation.


#### Summary

DA is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of DL models in histopathological imaging. By simulating real-world variations, it addresses data scarcity, class imbalance, and overfitting, enabling more robust and generalisable AI systems. Incorporating augmentation into your workflow is an essential step toward building effective and trustworthy models for medical imaging.
