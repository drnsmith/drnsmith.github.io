### Introduction
Deploying AI models for clinical use, particularly in breast cancer diagnosis, is a multi-faceted challenge. My project on the BreakHis dataset highlighted several computational and practical hurdles, such as optimising resource usage, addressing class imbalance, and ensuring model compatibility with real-world clinical workflows. This blog explores these challenges and the solutions implemented in my work, including specific metrics, code snippets, and insights.

### **Challenges in Deploying AI Models for Clinical Use**

#### **1. Computational Resource Constraints**
High-resolution images in the BreakHis dataset (224x224 pixels) and deep models like `ResNet50` and `DenseNet201` require significant computational resources. Training and inference on such models can strain hardware, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings.

**Metrics from Project**:
- Training time per epoch: ~12 minutes on a single GPU.
- Memory usage: ~8 GB for model inference on large batches.

**Solution**:
- **GPU Optimisation**: Enabled efficient memory management to ensure smooth training.
- **Model Optimisation**: Applied `TensorFlow Lite` for quantising the model for edge deployment, reducing inference time without compromising accuracy.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Convert a saved model to TensorFlow Lite with quantisation
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model("saved_model_path")
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
quantized_model = converter.convert()

# Save the optimised model
with open("quantized_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(quantized_model)
```

#### **2. Dataset Imbalance and Augmentation**
In the BreakHis dataset, malignant cases constituted 69% of the data, leading to potential bias in predictions. Augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling were implemented to balance the dataset and improve generalisation.

**Key Metrics**:
- Post-augmentation class balance: Benign (45%) vs. Malignant (55%).
- Model sensitivity on benign cases improved from 78% to 91%.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Apply data augmentation for balanced training
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=30,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.3,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode="nearest"
)

augmented_data = datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
```

#### **3. Interpretability and Trust**
Clinicians require interpretable predictions to trust AI models. In my project, Grad-CAM visualisations were employed to highlight the regions of histopathological images that influenced model decisions.

**Metrics**:
- Visualisation clarity: 90% of Grad-CAM overlays matched areas of interest.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Grad-CAM implementation
def grad_cam(model, img_array, last_conv_layer_name, pred_index=None):
    grad_model = Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=[model.get_layer(last_conv_layer_name).output, model.output])
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        conv_outputs, predictions = grad_model(img_array)
        if pred_index is None:
            pred_index = tf.argmax(predictions[0])
        loss = predictions[:, pred_index]
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, conv_outputs)
    pooled_grads = tf.reduce_mean(grads, axis=(0, 1, 2))
    conv_outputs = conv_outputs[0]
    heatmap = tf.reduce_mean(tf.multiply(pooled_grads, conv_outputs), axis=-1)
    heatmap = np.maximum(heatmap, 0) / tf.math.reduce_max(heatmap)
    return heatmap
```

#### **4. Scalability and Deployment**
Scalable deployment was achieved using `TensorFlow Serving`, allowing seamless integration with clinical systems. Docker containers ensured portability and ease of deployment across different hospital infrastructures.

**Key Metrics**:
- Inference time: Reduced from 1.5 seconds to 0.8 seconds per image.
- Deployment environment compatibility: Achieved using Docker with TensorFlow Serving.

```bash
# Docker command to deploy model with TensorFlow Serving
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name=tf_model_serving --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/saved_model,target=/models/model -e MODEL_NAME=model -t tensorflow/serving
```

### **BreakHis Dataset Deployment**

#### **Deployment Workflow**:
1. **Model Optimisation**: Quantised deep learning models for efficient inference.
2. **Augmented Training**: Balanced the dataset using data augmentation techniques.
3. **Interpretability**: Integrated Grad-CAM for explainable predictions.


#### **Performance Improvements**:
| **Metric**         | **Pre-Deployment** | **Post-Deployment** |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Sensitivity (Benign)| 78%               | 91%                  |
| Specificity         | 88%               | 94%                  |
| Inference Time      | 1.5s              | 0.8s                 |
| Trust Score         | -                 | 4.5/5                |
