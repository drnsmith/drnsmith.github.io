title: "Sentiment Speaks: Analysing Twitter Discourse on NASDAQ Companies"
description: "I analysed over 4 million tweets about NASDAQ-listed companies using Big Data tools and sentiment analysis. By leveraging distributed computing (MapReduce) and Python libraries, I extracted insights into public perception, sentiment trends, and recurring topics. Data visualisation and topic modelling further enriched the study, offering actionable insights for businesses and investors."
