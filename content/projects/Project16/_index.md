title: "Feature Engineering & Deployment for Personalised Diagnostics"
description: "I investigate how deep learning models can extract meaningful insights from breast cancer histopathology images. Using feature extraction, hierarchical clustering, and statistical analysis, the project uncovers intra-class variations that may unlock future avenues for personalised treatment. It also addresses the practical challenges of deploying AI systems in clinical environmentsâ€”bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world application."
