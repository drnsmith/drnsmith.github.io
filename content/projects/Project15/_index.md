title: "Trustworthy and Transparent AI for Histopathology"
description: "Accuracy is essential—but in healthcare, trust is non-negotiable. This project explores how to build AI models that aren’t just smart, but transparent and clinically trustworthy. It covers model calibration techniques like Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression to improve reliability. Interpretability tools such as Grad-CAM and LIME are applied to make black-box predictions more explainable. Evaluation goes beyond accuracy, introducing key healthcare metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and AUC to assess performance in real-world diagnostic scenarios."
