title: "Predicting Air Quality in Auckland (NZ): Harnessing AI to Tackle PM10 Pollution"
description: "In this project, we predict air pollution (pM10)levels in Auckland, using advanced machine learning techniques. Various models, including regression techniques, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were employed to understand pollution dynamics and forecast future trends. The insights can support policymakers in designing targeted interventions and improving urban air quality, ultimately safeguarding public health"
